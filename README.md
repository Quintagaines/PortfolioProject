# Data Analysis Portfolio

## Overview

Welcome to my Data Analysis Portfolio! This repository showcases two of my projects focused on extracting, cleaning, and analyzing data, with a particular emphasis on visualizations. Feel free to explore the projects and the skills demonstrated in each.

### Project 1: Covid Data Analysis

In this project, I delved into the world of Covid-19 data, demonstrating a comprehensive analysis pipeline. Here are the key steps:

1. **Data Extraction:** I extracted raw data from a reliable data source related to Covid-19.

2. **Data Cleaning:** Rigorous cleaning procedures were applied to ensure the data's accuracy and consistency.

3. **SQL Integration:** The cleaned data was imported into an SQL database, allowing for efficient storage and retrieval.

4. **Tableau Visualization:** Leveraging Tableau, I created a compelling dashboard that highlights two main aspects:

   - Population Vaccinated vs Continent and Locations: Visualizing the distribution of vaccinated populations across continents and specific locations.
   
   - Total New Cases vs Deaths by Continent and Location: Analyzing the relationship between new Covid-19 cases and related deaths across continents and specific locations.

### Project 2: Excel Data Analysis

For the second project, I focused on utilizing Excel for data analysis and visualization. Here's a breakdown of the project:

1. **Data Import:** Raw data was imported into Excel for processing.

2. **Data Cleaning:** I applied various data cleaning techniques to ensure the data's integrity.

3. **Pivot Tables:** Leveraging Excel's pivot tables, I organized and summarized the data for further analysis.

4. **Visualization:** I created three distinct visualization charts to represent different insights extracted from the data.

5. **Dashboard Creation:** To present a holistic view of the analysis, I developed a comprehensive dashboard, providing an at-a-glance overview of the key findings.

## Technologies Used

- Python (for data extraction and cleaning)
- SQL (for database integration)
- Tableau (for visualization in Project 1)
- Microsoft Excel (for data analysis and visualization in Project 2)

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **Project1_CovidData:**
  - Data extraction scripts
  - SQL database integration files
  - Tableau dashboard file

- **Project2_ExcelAnalysis:**
  - Raw data files
  - Excel analysis workbook
  - Visualization charts

Feel free to explore each project folder for a detailed understanding of the analysis and visualization processes.

## How to Run

Each project folder contains specific instructions on how to run or replicate the analysis. Ensure you have the required tools and dependencies installed.
